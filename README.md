The Fair Core License, or FCL, is a mostly-permissive non-compete [Fair Source](https://fair.io)
license that eventually changes to Open Source after 2 years. We currently support
Apache 2.0 and MIT change licenses.

The FCL is a great fit for projects that monetize both SaaS as well as self-hosting
with commercial features.
